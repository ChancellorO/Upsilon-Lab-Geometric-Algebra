## How to push to Git Repository

When pushing to repository, make sure you are within your own branch via `git branch`

Check to make sure everything is ready to commit via `git status`

if there are changes uncommited, first `git add .`

`git commit -m ""`, Note to add a useful short message for info about commit

Then finally `git push origin branch_name`, replacing branch_name with the name of your corresponding branch name.
